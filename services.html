                Getting found online
                Ever wonder why your website gets no traffic? It is because you cannot be found when Googled. You certainly would not open a retail store in a mall without signage and you shouldn’t publish a website without optimizing your website for traffic.
                
                The art of search engine optimization (SEO) is not only complex, but ever-changing. We have had considerable success in getting our clients’ websites listed prominently in the major search engines. There are many factors in achieving that success and we are experts in search engine optimization. We will get your website positioned high for your keywords.
                
                We stay current with the latest in changing trends related to search engine optimization and will work within your budget to get your website located by your targeted customers.If you currently have a website that doesn’t get enough traffic or isn’t converting traffic into sales, contact us. This evaluation goes beyond a simple website analysis and determines what your overall online presence looks like. TAO can provide your company with an Online Presence Analysis with the results  provided as a written report that uncovers:

                Managing your online presence
                Unlike gravity, what goes up on the Internet will never come down. A posting from a dissatisfied customer or a disgruntled employee to any one of the complaint websites can cost you losses to your business that you can’t even track.
                
                Realize, your customers have a right to expect good service and quality products from you. No one wants to feel as if they have been cheated or taken advantage of. However, the Internet is the Great Equalizer. The opportunity is there for all voices to be heard but once an online complaint is posted, it simply will never come down.The unfortunate nature of these negative comments is that you might have 75,000 customers who are satisfied with your services but have 300 complaints (which you have diligently worked to resolve). Only .04% of your customer base can be disatrous to your business. Even clients who have no web presence at all may already have a negative reputation to deal with.
